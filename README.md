# Solar Panel Disturbance Detection and Notification System

## Overview

This project, part of the Module CS3283 (Embedded Systems) in Semester 5, aims to enhance the efficiency and reliability of solar panel tracking system. By leveraging wind direction and object detection it aims to notify the system for an optimal solar panel energy output. 

## Objectives

- **Real time Disturbance Detection** -: Detect clouds or any other disturbances on the solar panel using a camera module
- **Solar Panel** -: Automatically rotate the solar panel to follow the sun's direction
- **Prior Notification** -: Send prior notificatons to alert when disturbances are detected, ensuring timely interventions to maintain solar panel efficiency

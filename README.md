## Solar Panel Disturbance Detection and Notification System

Overview

This project, part of the Module CS3283 (Embedded Systems) in Semester 5, aims to enhance the efficiency and reliability of solar panel systems. By leveraging wind direction, object detection through a camera module, and real-time notifications, the system ensures optimal solar panel orientation and early disturbance detection.
